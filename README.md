# FizzBuzz
A Test Driven solution to the Fizz Buzz problem, built using Reflection and SOLID design principles in C#.

#### Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
- If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the number.
- If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.
